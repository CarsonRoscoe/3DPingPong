# Console

The console follows a specific syntax which is "[Name] [Attribute] [Value]".
Note: Not all names support all attributes, and not all attributes support all values. The general rule of thumb is ball supports speed/color, Rules supports MaxScore.
Everything else only supports color.

- Background (Supports Color Attribute)
- LeftWall   (Supports Color Attribute)

- Ball       (Supports Color Attribute and Speed Attribute)
- PlayerOne  (Supports Color Attribute)
- PlayerTwo  (Supports Color Attribute)
- Rules      (Supports MaxScore Attribute)

Valid attributes are:
- Color      (Supports "Red", "Blue", "Green", "Black", "White", 6 character RGB and 8 character RGBA)
- Speed		 (Supports "Fast", "Slow", and any integer value. This changes the minimum speed relative to current minimum speed)
- MaxScore   (Supports any integer value above 0)

Valid values are:
- Red
- Green
- Blue
- Black
- White
- 6 character RGB (e.g. FF00FF)
- 8 character RGBA (e.g. FF00FFAA)
- Slow
